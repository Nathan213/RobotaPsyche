# Final Ideas
I'm still kind of torn between doing an essay or write a program, so I decided to put both potential ideas here. 

## Program
For my program, I plan to write an association program that mimics the universe in the book The Three Body Problem. In this universe, there are countless civilizations that spawn across the universe. Each civilization has their own progression rate, which can be based on their race traits, their "solar system" setup, et. cetera. There are fundamental laws that govern the interactions between civilizations in this universe. I will explain these laws here. The purpose of these laws is the author's attempt to provide a potential answer to the Fermi paradox. He starts off by setting out two fundamental principles of the universe:
1. The first need of a civilization is survival.
2. Civilizations grow, but the total amount of resources available in the universe stays the same.

From these principles, there arise sub-branches:
1. The Chain of Suspision
