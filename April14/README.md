# Final Ideas
I'm still kind of torn between doing an essay or write a program, so I decided to put both potential ideas here. 

## Program
For my program, I plan to write an association program that mimics the universe in the book The Three Body Problem. In this universe, there are countless civilizations that spawn across the universe. Each civilization has their own progression rate, which can be based on their race traits, their "solar system" setup, et. cetera. There are fundamental laws that govern the interactions between civilizations in this universe. I will explain these laws here. The purpose of these laws is the author's attempt to provide a potential answer to the Fermi paradox. He starts off by setting out two fundamental principles of the universe:
1. The first need of a civilization is survival.
2. Civilizations grow, but the total amount of resources available in the universe stays the same.

From these principles, there arise sub-branches:
1. The Chain of Suspision
Upon initial detection of another civilization, civ1 an civ2 have no way of trusting each other means peace. They also have no method of trusting each other as peaceful or warmonger civilizations. Thus, they cannot determine whether the other will fire the first shot. (This theory is based on the assumption that a civilization will have been powerful enough to destroy a planet at this stage) 

2. Technology Explosion
Any civilization that exists has the potential to explode in technology and innovation, surpassing its neighbors. For example, the civilization can be at a stage where they are about to go into an industrial revolution, so previous rate of development cannot be relied on. Another exmaple may be a pressure from lack of natural resources, or boost in growth in intelligence. These can all lead to a weak civilization becoming a strong one. Which also means a neighboring planet has the possibility to develop planet ending weapons at any time, even if they seem weak at the present moment. 

From these principles and dedections, the state of the universe can be predicted, and the author names this the Dark forest. In this forest, all civilizations are hunters who cannot see each other. The moment one detects another, they will shoot each other down. Thus, every hunter in the forest tries their very best to stay silent and hidden, no matter how powerful they are. 

### Program application
Talking specifically about the program, I plan to create a simplified version of a universe based on these principles. Civilizations stay stagnant, but their visibility changes overtime. A civilization can randomly experience technology booms, and random civilizations will also try to find fellow civilizations. However, any civilization that presents itself and becomes visible will be instantly destroyed by its neighbors. However, attacking civilizations will also have a chance of exposing themselves. I will create DNAs for all of these civilizations, which can include survivablity of enviroment, race intelligence, social construct, etc. The program will be able to run continuously, providing a simulation of what a universe theorized in the book looks like. 

## Essay Idea
I haven't really developed my essay idea, but I'm thinking along the lines of some research regarding a specific case of robot and law. For example, exporing how robotics will specifically impact liability law.
