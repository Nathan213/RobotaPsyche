# Production Assignment
This week's assignment required us to create a static program, which is something that I haven't done before. I've always been used to writing setup and draw before anything I do in processing, so it was a bit weird starting the assignment. However, I got over it quickly and was able to write out the program. Something that was a bit challenging was knowing if the program worked after writing it out. To tackle this issue, I drew a set of points on paper and figured out vm by myself, and tested those points in the program. The drawing is shown below, and the tested program is uploaded as well.

# Reading

Intentionally perosnlifying robbie and speedy. This is a work of fiction, and it's contents are contradictory to our previous discussion - why was the robot personified anyway?

Contrast between metal mind and metal body. Which do we dislike? Susuan Calvin had a "metal mind" and people called her non-human, robot like. The wife hated robbie because he had a metal body, although a very soft and "human like" mind.

Evaluate the merits and demerits of works of fiction like this on the progression of robotics. In this case, its readers will subconciously see robots as slaves, inferior to humans. They will also see them as incompetent and at risk of malfunction. 

  Follow up, specifically, discuss the effects that these examples can have on reader's perception of robots. 
    - Personification of robbie to win empathy of readers (conttradicts previous presentation of neruolink)
    - Best robot money can buy is something that acts like a human

The husband (an expert in robotics) empathized more to the robot than the wife (non-expert). Is this accurate? Expert knows the code, knows the inner workings, normal people see the appearence. Should it be the other way around?

First law of robots, they cannot harm humans. Is this a foreseeable/efective way to control robots? Or is this a way to calm the general public?
- Should there be universal laws coded into robots?
