# Production Assignment
This week's assignment required us to create a static program, which is something that I haven't done before. I've always been used to writing setup and draw before anything I do in processing, so it was a bit weird starting the assignment. However, I got over it quickly and was able to write out the program. Something that was a bit challenging was knowing if the program worked after writing it out. To tackle this issue, I drew a set of points on paper and figured out vm by myself, and tested those points in the program. The drawing is shown below, and the tested program is uploaded as well.

# Reading

In the introductory scene, susan was called non-human becuase of her cold characteristic. they called her a robot. Why is this our perception of them?

Follow that comment, Susan stood up from her chair — "she wasn't tall and she looked frail" — by this logic, does our perception of a robot's coldness only stem from its brain, its conciousness? The people in the book certainly did so.
