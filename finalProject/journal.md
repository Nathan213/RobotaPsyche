**Got done:** Currently formulating my stance on the subject. I don't plan to write anything yet, still reading a lot of material. Finished reading the EU report on civil laws in robotics today. 

**Difficulties: ** Still very blurry on what exactly I want to argue, just need more reading
**Next step:** Find more scholarly articles on asimov's rules on robotics. Trying to avoid comments on the laws themselves, I want to focus on the format not the content. 

# April 27
**Got done:** Read up some more on Asimov's laws. Also read a joint study on the challenges of regulating robots
**Difficulties:** Still can't find an intersting stance to write about on the subject. The paper on robot regulation is too focused on privacy and civil law, I want to think about all of law. 
**Next step:** Just need to keep reading, hopefully will find a good stance to talk about.
