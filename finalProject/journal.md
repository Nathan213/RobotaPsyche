# April 25
**Got done:** Currently formulating my stance on the subject. I don't plan to write anything yet, still reading a lot of material. Finished reading the EU report on civil laws in robotics today. 
**Difficulties: ** Still very blurry on what exactly I want to argue, just need more reading
**Next step:** Find more scholarly articles on asimov's rules on robotics. Trying to avoid comments on the laws themselves, I want to focus on the format not the content. 

# April 26
**Got done:** Read up some more on Asimov's laws. Also read a joint study on the challenges of regulating robots
**Difficulties:** Still can't find an intersting stance to write about on the subject. The paper on robot regulation is too focused on privacy and civil law, I want to think about all of law. 
**Next step:** Just need to keep reading, hopefully will find a good stance to talk about. 

# April 27
**Got done:** Was inspired by law class today. The topic was on feminist legal theory, and one of the main challenges to reduce patriarchal law is the barrier of privacy and private life. What happens between husband and wife, for example, are usually out of the reach of law. Thus, many issues that relate to female inferiority and abuse is hard to address. This made me think about ways to regulate humans inside of domestic homes. To do this requires the humans to follow the law even when they are out of law's reach. This thought reminded me of the robots in _I, Robot_. I still haven't found any interesting stances for Asimov format laws for robots, so why not try humans?
**Difficulties:** Humans can't have Asimov type laws coded into them, so proceeding with this argument requires a fantasy thought experiment with robotic enhancements that have law coded into them. 
**Next step:** Need to check with professor tomorrow if it's ok to formulate my essay around the thought experiment. Also the topic in general 

# April 28
**Got done:** Talked with professor, got the green light. Did some more reading that relates to my new argument, including _the Path of the Law_, and Rousseau's _Discourse on Inequality_
**Difficulties:** The topic itself is very difficult to discuss, mainly because I want to go against the popular position and try to advocate for coding laws into human enhancements. 
**Next step:** Currently have one argument down for my stance, specifically prediction theory and how law is about consequences. Need to find more arguments.

**Got done:** Basically finished the essay, did more readings on both the theoretical and the practical. Theoretically, I added Rousseau's discourse and his social contract theory to strengthen the moral grounds of my proposition. Practically, I found the example of police surveillance and predictive policing to provide real life examples of trading freedom for security. 
**Difficulties:** Rousseau's theory was especially difficult to relate to the topic at hand, mainly because his ideas on inequality largely relates to social classes and my thought experiment doesn't really solve inequalities between classes.
