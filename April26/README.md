# Little Lost Robot reflection questions

## Is there an unbreakable law of robotics?
In the story, the general stated that there MUST have been some robots that were not strictly coded with the first law of robotics. One of the main counter-arguments against Asimov's laws is that they are restricting for the robot. However, the first law is the most intuitive one, but even that law is said to be limiting in this story. If not harming humans is still a non-universally accepted law, could there be any law is universally acceptable for robots? Always obey orders?

## Why are robot psychologists neccesary?
If humans can hard code laws that are unbreakable into humans, why is there a need to separate developers and coders with robotpsychologists? Wouldn't the manufacterers know what's wrong?

## Legislation was weaponized against robot developers in this story. Apart from educating legislators to prevent incidents like that of the story, are there any other methods for Robot developers to secure their autonomy?
