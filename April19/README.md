# Reason discussion questions
1. When the humans assembled a robot in front of cutie, it did not recognize the robbot as being built by a human. If humans one day assemble a robot complex enough to spring conciousness, is this conciousness a work of humans? 
2. Critically examining the story, Cutie looked down upon the humans as lesser beings because they lacked robot's reasoning faculties. However, It then created a religion that explained many things as "the will of the master", and naming itself the prophet. Does this action comply with the robot's initial characteristic of reason above all? 
3. In the story, the final explanation for the robots' behavior is the first law of robotics, as well as it overriding the second law. Cutie's actions, although disrespectful towards humans, still achieves these laws subconciously. If it comes to a day where humans decide to use a system like Asimov's laws to govern robots (instead of actual laws), can this system actual work? In other words, the only reason this story made people uncomfortable was because the laws of robotics were faulty. The system of coding laws into robots was not at fault. In fact, the system worked perfectly, because the robots strictly followed them, despite looking down on humans. So if we perfect the laws that we code into robots, would the system hold up?
