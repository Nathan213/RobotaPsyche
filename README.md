Difficulties:
  - In the process of implementing the keypressed function, I got confused as to where I needed to put the function. 
    Specifically, it took me some time to figure out whether to put it in the main code or the class code, as well as
    how variables would fit into the function. 
  - I ran into an old problem that I had in intro to IM, which is the keyPressed function doesn't support pressing two
    keys at once.
