Main difficulties
  - For this project, the most time consuming part for me was creating a flow field that pointed all the individual points to the center. 
    Specifically, it took me some time to figure out how to return the value of the desired direction for each point in the logic of the
    for loop. 
  - Another challenge I had was using array lists to call movers. I think my main problem with this was an issue of syntax. I couldn't
    figure out where and what I should have written to properly call objects with an array list. To solve this, I took a peek at some 
    classmate's work (Amina and Katie), and proceeded to figure out the process. 

Discoveries
  - A quite simply thing that I learned was the functions of arguments. Previously, I was still a little bit fuzzy on what was going on 
    inside the brackets behind methods, but this assignment helped me clarify that.
